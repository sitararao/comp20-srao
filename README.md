# comp20-srao 

This Git repository is documentation of my work in my Web Programming (COMP20) course at Tufts. 

My favorite assignment was the semester group project because it brought together so many pieces of what we learned over the semester to make one cohesive product. Of the smaller assignments I really liked Assignment 4; while it is fun (and hard) to make a product that works, I find it much more fun to break things. I really enjoyed playing Google's XSS game while working on this assignment.

I feel as if I've grown immensely since the beginning of this course. While I have only scratched the surface of learning how the Web works, the content of this course is much more within reach than I imagined, and that makes me eager to learn more. 

The most important thing I learned in this course was the importance of documentation. More so than in Comp11 and Comp15, I found myself not worrying about memorizing how to code and focused more on learning principles. So, while it was useful and necessary to learn about the structure of an HTML web page, once I had one working I could look back to it as reference when I was working on HTML for the semester group project, for example. Using git for documentation was also really helpful in keeping track of my changes, because I was able to revert back to earlier versions of my code when I inevitably broke things.

Moving forward, I would like to learn more about databases, especially SQL databases, and how to securely/efficiently handle large amounts of data.
