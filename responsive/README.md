Lab 4 README

I believe all aspects of the assignment have been correctly implemented. While I think everything is functional, there might have been a better way to write my css file so that there were not so many declarations for each @media rule.

I have not discussed this assignment with anyone. I used the 2 given resources for this assignment in addition to this website: https://pagecrafter.com/responsive-background-image-sprites-css-tutorial/

I spent approximately 2-3 hours on this assigment.
