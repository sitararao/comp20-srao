Comp20 Assignment 2 README

I believe all aspects of this assignment have been correctly implementedâ€“ however I only got everything working properly after the passenger/vehicle switch, so I am hoping there is nothing I missed on the vehicle side.

I spent about 8 hours on this assignment in total.

I discussed this project with Ming, TA Michael Robinson (who helped a lot, thank you!), and another Comp20 student Aidan Schertz.
